# russell-bookmark-app

Unfortunately was not able to complete functionality of the app.

So far I was able to add a bookmark but unable to further edit, delete, or visit the link.

was able to get the expand but wasn't able to close it and it hides the other bookmarks when expanded.

I had a terrible time trying to get the app to show in GH-pages. I asked my mentor and spoke with a ThinkChat helper. they didn't know how to make it show when the index.html is in the src file and not the root.

Need some guidance on where I'm going wrong.

Here is the live link. https://thinkful-ei-rabbit.github.io/russell-bookmark-app/

As a user:

I can add bookmarks to my bookmark list. Bookmarks contain:

title
url link
description
rating (1-5)
I can see a list of my bookmarks when I first open the app

All bookmarks in the list default to a "condensed" view showing only title and rating
I can click on a bookmark to display the "detailed" view

Detailed view expands to additionally display description and a "Visit Site" link
I can remove bookmarks from my bookmark list

I receive appropriate feedback when I cannot submit a bookmark

Check all validations in the API documentation (e.g. title and url field required)
I can select from a dropdown (a <select> element) a "minimum rating" to filter the list by all bookmarks rated at or above the chosen selection

(Extension feature - optional) I can edit the rating and description of a bookmark in my list
