# russell-bookmark-app

Unfortunately was not able to complete functionality of the app.

So far I was able to add a bookmark but unable to further edit, delete, or visit the link.

was able to get the expand but wasn't able to close it and it hides the other bookmarks when expanded.

I had a terrible time trying to get the app to show in GH-pages. I asked my mentor and spoke with a ThinkChat helper. they didn't know how to make it show when the index.html is in the src file and not the root.

Need some guidance on where I'm going wrong.
